            Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural
            philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most influential
            men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
            Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most
            influential book in the history of science.

            Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of
            relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by
            the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
            Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for
            his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

            Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as
            the most important scientist and inventor of the modern age, a man
            who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many
            revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and
            magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
